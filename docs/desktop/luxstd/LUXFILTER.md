# LuxFilter Technical Documentation

## Overview
LuxFilter is a modular filtering system designed for processing and scoring digital assets efficiently. It integrates with the Luxoria ecosystem and provides a pipeline-based approach to apply filtering algorithms to image data.

## Features
- **Modular filtering pipeline** with weighted algorithms
- **Event-driven architecture** for processing notifications
- **Parallelized execution** for optimized performance
- **Error handling** for robust processing

---

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### `LuxFilter` Module
- Implements `IModule`
- Handles initialization, execution, and shutdown
- Provides logging for module actions

#### `PipelineService`
- Manages the execution of filtering algorithms
- Tracks progress and scores
- Uses concurrency for efficiency

#### `IFilterAlgorithm`
- Defines a standard interface for filtering algorithms
- Implements a scoring method based on image analysis

---

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that the **Luxoria ecosystem** is installed and configured properly.
- Your project should reference the necessary **LuxFilter libraries**.
- Implement and register `IEventBus` for event-driven interactions.

### Installation
1. Clone or download the **LuxFilter** module.
2. Add the project reference in your Luxoria-based application.
3. Implement `IModule` interface in your module system.

### Running the Module
1. Initialize the module using `Initialize()`.
2. Configure the filtering pipeline using `AddAlgorithm()`.
3. Pass image data through the `Compute()` function.

### Example Usage
```csharp
var luxFilter = new LuxFilter();
luxFilter.Initialize(eventBus, context, logger);
luxFilter.Execute();
```

---

## Initialization

```csharp
public void Initialize(IEventBus eventBus, IModuleContext context, ILoggerService logger)
```
- Subscribes to filtering events
- Initializes logger and context

## Filtering Process

### **1. Pipeline Configuration**
- Uses `AddAlgorithm(IFilterAlgorithm algorithm, double weight)` to add algorithms
- Ensures the total weight of all algorithms does not exceed 1.0

### **2. Image Processing**
- Processes images using `Compute(IEnumerable<(Guid, SKBitmap)> bitmaps)`
- Applies each algorithm in the workflow to every image

### **3. Score Computation**
- Each image receives a final score based on weighted algorithm outputs
- Results are returned as `(Guid, double)` tuples

---

## Event Handling

### **Score Computation Event**
```csharp
public event EventHandler<(Guid, double)> OnScoreComputed;
```
- Notifies when an image has been processed and scored

### **Pipeline Completion Event**
```csharp
public event EventHandler<TimeSpan> OnPipelineFinished;
```
- Notifies when the pipeline has finished executing

---

## Error Handling & Logging
- Uses `ILoggerService` for structured logs
- Exception handling ensures robust error reporting
- Logs execution times for performance analysis

---

## Performance Optimizations
- Uses **parallel processing** for scoring
- Implements **concurrent data structures** for thread safety
- Optimized **event-driven execution** to reduce overhead

---

## Future Enhancements
- **Dynamic algorithm tuning** for real-time adjustments
- **Support for additional image formats**
- **Graphical visualization of scores**

---

## Conclusion
LuxFilter provides a scalable and efficient filtering pipeline for processing images in the Luxoria ecosystem. Its modular design, event-driven execution, and parallel processing capabilities make it an ideal choice for large-scale image scoring and analysis.
