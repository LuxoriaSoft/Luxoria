# Luxoria Standard Modules (LuxStd Modules)

## Overview
Luxoria Standard Modules (LuxStd Modules) are a collection of core modules designed to provide essential functionalities within the Luxoria ecosystem. These modules follow a standardized architecture, ensuring seamless integration, extensibility, and interoperability with other Luxoria components.

## Characteristics of LuxStd Modules
- **Modular Design**: Each module follows a plug-and-play architecture.
- **Event-Driven**: Modules communicate through event-based interactions using `IEventBus`.
- **Extensible**: Can be enhanced with additional features without breaking compatibility.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Designed for high performance with non-blocking operations.
- **Logging & Error Handling**: Implements structured logging via `ILoggerService` for debugging and diagnostics.

## List of LuxStd Modules
### 1. `LuxImport` [Read More](LUXIMPORT.md)
- Handles the importation, indexing, and management of digital asset collections.
- Processes large datasets with asynchronous operations and progress tracking.

### 2. `LuxFilter` [Read More](LUXFILTER.md)
- Provides a filtering pipeline for processing and scoring digital assets.
- Uses a modular filtering algorithm framework with weighted execution.


## Conclusion
LuxStd Modules form the backbone of the Luxoria ecosystem, ensuring a robust, scalable, and modular approach to handling digital assets. Their event-driven and extensible design makes them ideal for a wide range of applications within the system.
