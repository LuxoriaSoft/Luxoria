# Meeting Recap

**Date & Time:**  
20 November 2024 5PM06

**Attendees:**  
- Romain B  
- Luxoria Team

## 1. Executive Summary
The team reviewed storage strategies for our LuxStudio Solution. We initially considered migrating from a document-DB approach to a traditional file-system model. However, after evaluating long-term modularity, performance, and maintainability, we unanimously agreed to pursue a bucket-style database solution using MinIO.

## 2. Discussion Points

### Current Storage Model
- LuxStudio assets are presently stored in a document-oriented database.  
- Concerns were raised about scalability and operational complexity.

### File-System Migration Proposal
- **Pros:**  
  - Simplifies backup and direct file access.  
- **Cons:**  
  - Limited scalability in distributed environments.  
  - Potential performance bottlenecks under heavy I/O loads.

### Bucket-Style DB (MinIO) Evaluation
- **Modularity:**  
  - MinIOâ€™s S3-compatible API allows plug-and-play integration with existing cloud-native tooling.  
- **Performance:**  
  - Distributed, erasure-coded clusters ensure high throughput and fault tolerance.  
- **Sustainability:**  
  - Easier maintenance and upgrades via rolling updates.  
  - Broad community and commercial support.

## 3. Decision
**Adopt a bucket-style object storage solution using MinIO for all LuxStudio asset storage moving forward.**

## 4. Next Steps & Action Items

- Prototype MinIO deployment (single-node) and validate core APIs. 
- Benchmark read/write performance against existing document-DB setup. 
- Draft architecture diagram and integration plan with LuxStudio
- Review security and backup strategies for MinIO cluster
