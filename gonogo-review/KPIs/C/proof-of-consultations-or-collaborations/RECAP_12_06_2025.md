**Attendees:**

- Whole Luxoria Team

## 1. Executive Summary  
Our current distribution process requires users to manually download a GitHub release, unzip it, and move files into Program Files. To streamline deployment and improve user experience, we have decided to develop a native executable installer.

---

## 2. Discussion Points

### Current Installation Process
- Navigate to our GitHub repository’s “Releases” page  
- Download the `.zip` archive of the latest version  
- Extract contents locally  
- Manually move the application folder into `C:\Program Files\…`  
- (Optional) Add to PATH or create desktop shortcuts

### Pain Points
- Multiple manual steps prone to user error  
- No version-check or upgrade path  
- Lack of automated shortcut creation and uninstaller  
- Support overhead for installation issues

### Proposed Installer Solution
- **Executable Installer**  
  - Bundle binaries, assets, and dependencies  
  - Automate directory placement under `Program Files`  
  - Create Start menu/desktop shortcuts  
  - Provide an uninstaller entry in Control Panel  
- **Potential Tools**  
  - NSIS, Inno Setup, Windows Installer (MSI)  
  - Consider cross-platform options if needed in future

## 3. Decision  
Proceed with designing and building a native Windows executable installer for our application.

---

## 4. Next Steps & Action Items

Research and select an installer framework (e.g., NSIS, Inno Setup, MSI)
Develop a prototype executable installer
Conduct cross-environment testing (Windows versions & permissions)
Update documentation and publish installer on GitHub Releases
