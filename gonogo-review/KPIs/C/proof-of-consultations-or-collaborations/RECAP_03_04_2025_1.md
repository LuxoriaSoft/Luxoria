## 1. Executive Summary  
Initiated the LuxStudio refactor to enhance user experience and operational robustness. Key focus areas include UI improvements, English language fixes, automated Kubernetes deployments via CircleCI, and strengthened user security with hCaptcha and a two-step registration form.

---

## 2. Discussion Points

### UI & Usability Enhancements
- Revamp layouts and controls for clearer workflows  
- Improve responsiveness and accessibility standards  
- Standardize component library for consistency

### English Language Fixes
- Audit existing UI text for grammar and clarity  
- Implement i18n framework to simplify future translations  
- Review error messages and tooltips for user-friendly wording

### Automated Deployment (Kubernetes + CircleCI)
- Define Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingress) under `k8s/`  
- Create CircleCI pipeline:  
  - Build Docker image on merge to `main`  
  - Push to container registry  
  - Apply rolling updates to staging and production clusters  
- Integrate health-checks and rollback strategies

### User Security & Registration Workflow
- Embed hCaptcha on signup and login forms  
- Design double-form registration:  
  1. User enters email & password  
  2. System sends temporary code via email  
  3. User submits code to complete account activation  
- Log and monitor failed attempts for anomaly detection

---

## 3. Decision  
Move forward with the full refactor as outlined, prioritizing UI polish and deployment automation in parallel, followed by security enhancements.
