# Meeting Recap

**Date & Time:**  
3 April 2025 2PM

**Attendees:**  
- Yoo, Y  
- Noah GOSCINIAK

## 1. Executive Summary  
Yoo, Young Joon shared expert insights on modern computer vision segmentation techniques. Key recommendations included U-Net variants and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) deep learning models to address our image segmentation needs.

## 2. Discussion Points

### Computer Vision Segmentation Overview
- Importance of precise pixel-level classification for our use cases (e.g., medical imagery, scene understanding).  

### U-Net Family of Models
- **Architecture:** Encoder–decoder with skip connections for fine-grained feature recovery.  
- **Variants:**  
  - U-Net++ (nested U-Net) for richer multi-scale feature fusion.  
  - Attention U-Net to focus on relevant spatial regions.  
- **Pros & Cons:**  
  - + Excellent performance with limited data.  
  - – Higher memory footprint; may require patch-based training.

### Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs)
- **Core Idea:** Replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers for end-to-end segmentation.  
- **Notable Models:**  
  - FCN-8s for coarse-to-fine upsampling.  
  - DeepLab (atrous convolutions + CRF) for sharper boundaries.  
- **Pros & Cons:**  
  - + Simpler architecture & faster inference.  
  - – Can struggle with small object segmentation without additional post-processing.

### Model Selection Criteria
- **Data Volume & Annotation Quality**  
- **Compute Resources & Inference Latency**  
- **Target Application Requirements** (e.g., boundary precision vs. speed)

## 3. Decision  
Evaluate and prototype both a U-Net variant and an FCN-based model on our dataset to compare accuracy, speed, and resource utilization.

---

## 4. Next Steps & Action Items

Set up data pipeline and preprocess images for segmentation tasks
Implement baseline U-Net and run initial training/validation
Implement baseline FCN-8s (and DeepLab if resources allow)
Compare metrics (IoU, pixel accuracy, inference time)
Review results with Yoo, Young Joon and refine model selection
